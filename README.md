# Property-driven Neural Network Training

This library is a generic implementation of adversarial training of neural networks using TensorFlow.

The goal is to train neural networks that have a stronger compliance to a desired user-defined property. This is performed using adversarial training, specifically using projected gradient descent (PGD) adversarial attacks.
